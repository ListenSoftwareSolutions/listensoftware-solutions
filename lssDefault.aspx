Hiro spoke by phone with Zen Jia, the prime minister of China.
<p>
"Prime Minister, I hear rumors that China is planning to buy gold for twice the spot price.  Is this true?"
<p>
Prime Minister Zen Jia replied, "It is true.  Our Shanghai Commodity exchange is out of silver.  We feel it is in our best interests to revalue the gold and silver prices.  We are willing to buy gold and silver payable in dollars for twice the spot price.  The spot price has been heavily manipulated by the Electronic Trade Funds ETFs and futures naked short buying."
<p>
Hiro reflected on the situation.  There was a moment of awkward silence.  Hiro knew China held over $1.7 trillion in US treasuries.  He also knew if China attempted to sell of US treasuries, the Federal Reserve would borrow money from the Treasury to buy the treasuries being sold off.  The money supply would increase, and the dollar would decrease.  The devaluing dollar would reduce Chinese imports and increase US exports.  China could not sell off its US Treasuries.  It had to convert money into assets.  The long-running method was to use a sovereign wealth fund to invest in real estate, commercial properties and businesses.  The second method would be to buy precious metals and pay for the commodity in dollars.
<p>
"I see."
<p>
"Is this part of your plan to increase acceptance of your gold -backed yuan?  Are you planning to replace the dollar?"
<p>
Prime Minister Jia replied, "Oh no.  We are not going to replace the dollar.  We are going to compete with the dollar providing a 120-allied-counties, Chinese currency to use for engaging in trade.  The dollar will not be replaced."
<p>
Hiro said, "If China begins to buy gold at twice the price, then China�s existing gold reserve of 15,000 tons will be worth more.  So, with an investment of several billion dollars, your gold-backed currency will become more valuable and desired.  More central banks and foreign companies will purchase the gold backed yuan."
<p>
Prime Minister Jia said, "We have waited patiently to see gold prices return to their actual market value.  However, the fed and other central banks control our currency valuations through derivatives.  We have grown impatient and want to become our own brand and entity."
<p>
"Gold is the international standard by which commodities and services can be measured and exchanged.  All currencies must be backed by gold.
<p>
Hiro replied, "$2 to $3 trillion a day are sold or bought on the foreign exchange.  The gold yuan must be interchangeable and liquid.  That means the big currency exchanges must buy and sell yuan.  The artificially low price for yuan cannot be controlled by the central banks.  Instead, the price must be allowed to float to demand.  Chinese products could suddenly become expensive."
<p>
Hiro replied, "China buys Gold and gets rid of inflated dollars.  The value of China gold reserve rise on a few billion dollars worth of buying.  The futures markets correct in price to the rise expectations of future demand and price support for gold.  The gold back yuan gains in strength, value, and acceptance.  If China tried to dump its US treasuries, the fed would step and buy the bonds with dollars.  The money supply would expand and China would end up still holding dollars.�
<p>
Prime Minister Jia replied, "Consumer credit will be more available due to loan interest rates and increased money supply.  Chinese products will move into the luxury sector of industry, such as:  fuel cell cars, appliances, and high end electronics.  China will invest into better research and development and provide high-quality-engineered products."
<p>
Hiro replied, "With all due respect, I don't see China creating anything new.  All the new innovations are coming out of America.  I still believe in American innovation and the dollar.  America still has the most creative and innovative thinkers in the world.  I hope that does not sound arrogant to you, but it is true."
<p>
Prime Minister Jia commented, �Japan�s central banks have devalued the yen causing it to drop in value.  The devaluing yen makes Japanese exports more cheap and increases Japanese economic output preventing a recession.  At the same time, Germany, Brazil, South Korea, and Taiwan experience economic slow down, as money shifts to Japan.  Japan becomes more competitive in the export markets.  The increase in exports helps pay for industry loans and other types of debt.  Currency devaluation acts as a short term stimulus. �
<p>
�The Bank of Japan intervenes in the currency devaluation by selling off large amounts of Yen.  This keeps Japan�s economy from falling into deflation.� 
<p>
�Japan�s energy costs are expensive.  Japan imports most of its oil from Iran.  Iran is the fourth largest exporter of oil.  Tensions in the Middle East and tensions in Europe between Russia have caused Japan to cut back on Iranian oil.  Japan is importing Liquid Natural Gas to offset nuclear power plant shutdowns.�
<p>
Prime Minister Jia said, �China will maintain a stable path of currency valuation.  Trade between Japan and China will increasingly be done in yuan and not dollars.  Dollars will play a dominate role for decades, but more trade will increase to yuan through yen and yuan currency swaps.  The yuan will increase in value as gold prices increase.  �
<p>
�In the currency swap Japan will acquire yuan and pay for Chinese imports in yuan.  When it is time to reverse the currency swap, Japan will pay back yuan in expensive yen because gold prices will rise. China currency will gain in strength against the yen.  This will allow China to buy more unfinished goods from Japan and sale finished goods to America.� 
<p>
�Rising Gold prices do not threaten China�s economic growth. China�s gold reserve valuations rise and the rising valuations make the gold backed yuan stronger. The stronger currency helps China grow.�
<p>
�China will manage the yuan appreciate by creating a network of trading countries willing to exchange in yuan.�
<p>
�Hiro, you can see our logic in offering twice the market price for gold is reasonable.  China will benefit from higher gold prices.�
<p>
�China is concerned about a slowing economy.  The Central Bank of China has inject $294 billion to keep money liquid, interest rates low, and growth from collapsing.  China is trying to find new markets in South America, Africa, and Indonesia.  The rebalancing of trade will help sustain growth long term.�
