          <h2>Why do you need us</h2>
          <p>We sit down with you and listen to your requirements. I have worked with numerous companies and know that the process starts by gather a requirement. Once we understand your requirement, I work to create a mobile and web and cloud solution that will match your requirement. I document the technical process and make the c# code available, if needed. Your company may not have experience in C# or Azure. I do the heavy lifting to decide and select the technology that best meets your business requirement. Why waste time on building an application, no one wants?
          <br>
          Describe the business problem, management wants to solve and build a story. Business people are not technical. Don't worry about how the story will be created. Note, the story tells, what your business wants to build. Let us, figure out the "how" the data collection system will be built. As managers, you know the two variables to collect which matter too your organization!</p>

          <h2>Project Management and Business Analysis - matter!</h2>
          <p>Design is critical in building the right product. The better the design the less coding is required. Software as a service has allowed companies to use other companies platforms to use external functionality. Functionality like SMS messaging, cloud storage, and information of things. Understand the process and building a great design helps establish a platform. Platforms are the key to long term sustainability and support. We want to be able to support your applications long term, upgrade them as the technology changes and charge for each transaction.</p>

          <h2>Value added</h2>
          <p>Listen Software Solutions will gather the IOT - Internet of Things, data into a hosted database. You don't need to worry about the pain of gathering the data, setting up the database or the code to talk with the devices. We do the heavy lifting. You provide the definition of the product to be built. One of the biggest reasons for failure is building the wrong product--a product that you do not want. We build the product you want to gather the data. We figure out the technical how-to. You tell us what you want for your business. We work to define your objectives and the key indicators that will tell you if youâ€™re reaching your goal and confirm your beliefs about your organization.</p>

          <p>Computer Science is based on cybernetics or feedback. Listen Software Solutions will provide feedback to the users by email and SMS messaging. Feedback improves the quality of the system and increases the robustness of the functions and features of the system.</p>

          <h2>Cost structure</h2>
          <p>We take the risk of building the app. We make money on the transactional fees. Once production starts, transaction block counts can be purchased for as low as a $10 for 1,000 data transactions. We also provide a portable unit to display Key Indicators and Performance reports with a small access fee.</p>

          <h2>Why we love our work</h2>
          <p>Here is our story. We love to solve hard problems. For over a decade, we have been successful at solving problems that others are only now starting to address. We believe that no successful company should be without technology support to achieve their business requirements. It is exciting to add value to a company through automated data collection, where it was previously only gathered manually. Our unique, exciting technology allows customers to see their own information visually. We like to make our customers smarter by providing dashboards and visual systems that serve to help them understand their own data. It is a great feeling knowing how the new information gathering effort is increasing profits and reducing company waste</p>

          <h2>Devices</h2>
          <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) process begins with the machine. A state machine made possible through an operating system runs on a device. The state machine can do many things at the same time: it can display data to the user, gather data from the user and gather data from other devices, either by Bluetooth, sockets and pipes, or serial communication. The data is wrapped up in a data packet called a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and sent by HTTPS to a server web program. The web program then receives the data and stores it on large databases like Microsoft SQL Server.
          <br>
          The Galaxy tablet uses the Android operating system to create a state machine where one or more applications can execute. The tablet application is written in the Java programming language. Java is used to communicate between the tablet and external devices. An external device can be connected by Bluetooth or socket. The device is then known by its machine address internally. The name of the external device and its machine address are used to communicate with it. The serial object is then associated with the external device, and an input or output datastream is bound to the serial communication. Data being transmitted from the external device is intercepted in a call back function in the Java application. The data is converted to text and displayed on a user-friendly form. The user reviews the data, and he presses a button for transmission of the data to a server. A web server processes the HTTP post and calls the web API being requested. The data is received on the server and then saved to a database table for storage.
          <br>
          The Samsung Galaxy tablet running an android operating system is the preferred choice for gathering data from remote locations. The tablet is wifi, 4G, and bluetooth capable. Read about the specifications on Amazon.</p>

          <h2>Analytics</h2>
          <p>Analytics aggregates data into a meaningful presentation allowing the view to see trends, variances from the standard, and predictions.
          <br>
          Powerful Dashboards give you a glance of your data, as it is being collected.</p>

          <h2>Process</h2>
          <p>The data gathering process begins with the state machine. A state machine made possible through an Android operating system runs on a device. The state machine can do many things at the same time: it can display data to the user, it can gather data from the user, and it can gather data from other devices either by bluetooth, sockets and pipes, or serial communication. These methods of data communication are simple, they make possible, the transmission of data from one device to another.
          <br>
          The information is stored in large databases on the cloud. The information in the database can be used later to create dashboard, reports, and data extracts.
          <br>
          The galaxy tablet uses the android operating system to create a state machine where one or more applications can execute. The tablet application is written in the c# language. The c# language is used to communicate with the tablet and external devices. An external device can be connected to by bluetooth or socket. The device is then known by its machine address internally. The name of the external device and its machine address are used to communicate with it.
          <br>
          Data being transmitted from the external device is intercepted in by a serial communication function in the application. The data is converted to text and displayed on an user form for display. The user reviews the data and they presses a user interface button for transmission of the data to a server. The data is received on the server and then saved to a database table for storage.
          <br>
          The sheer number of transactions involved makes the cloud the right place to store the data for analytics. Database costs are always the inhibitor to large scale projects. Research methods for reduce database transactional cost is always the goal.
        <br>
        The next step is to build an analytics engine to help customers study and understand their data. Less than 25% of the people gathering information from things are studying the data. Analytics and Key Performance Indicators are helpful tools in understand what is happening in data.
