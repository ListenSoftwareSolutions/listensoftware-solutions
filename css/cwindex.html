        <h3>Why do you need us</h3>

Why waste time on building an application, no one wants?</p>

We want to be able to support your applications long term, upgrade them as the technology changes and charge for each transaction.

        <h3>Cost structure</h3>
        <p>We take the risk of building the app. We make money on the transactional fees. Once production starts, transaction block counts can be purchased for as low as a $10 for 1,000 data transactions. We also provide a portable unit to display Key Indicators and Performance reports with a small access fee.

        <h3>Why we love our work</h3>
        <p>Here is our story. We love to solve hard problems. For over a decade, we have been successful at solving problems that others are only now starting to address.
          <br>We believe that no successful company should be without technology support to achieve their business requirements. It is exciting to add value to a company through automated data collection, where it was previously only gathered manually. Our unique, exciting technology allows customers to see their own information visually. We like to make our customers smarter by providing dashboards and visual systems that serve to help them understand their own data. It is a great feeling knowing how the new information gathering effort is increasing profits and reducing company waste</p>

                                                The process of collecting data is possible because of the network.  Interprocess communication, namely, tcp/ip allows information gathered on one point, of the network, to be transmitted, to another point, on the network.  The seemless transmission of data makes the network one of the best value added technology, for your organization.
