I have worked with numerous companies and know that the process starts by gather a requirement.  Once we understand your requirement, I work to create a mobile and web and cloud solution that will match your requirement.  I document the technical process and make the java and c# code available, if needed.  Your company may not have experience in Java or AWS or Azure.  I do the heavy lifting to decide and select the technology that best meets your business requirement.  Why waste time on building an application, no one wants?  The technology does not stop with web reporting and dashboards, it continues on to apps that create bar codes, read scale weights, and communicate with other devices. I figure out how to get the data you need from remote devices.  I build the app that collects the data remotely using tablet technology and sql lite databases on the tablet and transmits the data to the server or cloud through network posts.

                            <p><b>Project management and Business Analysis matter!</b>  Design is critical in building the right product.  The better the design the less coding is required.  Software as a service has allowed companies to use other companies platforms to use external functionality.  Functionality like SMS messaging, cloud storage, and information of things.  Understand the process and building a great design helps establish a platform.  Platforms are the key to long term sustainability and support.  We want to be able to support your applications long term, upgrade them as the technology changes and charge for each transaction.

Feedback improves the quality of the system and increases the robustness of the functions and features of the system</p>

                            <p><b>Help us get started!</b> Describe the business problem, management wants to solve and build a story. Business people are not technical. Don't worry about how the story will be created. Note, the story tells, what your business wants to build. Let us, figure out the "how" the data collection system will be built.  As managers, you know the two variables to collect which matter too your organization!</p>
                            <p><b>Value Added:</b>: Listen Software Solutions will gather the IOT (expand acronym) data into a hosted database. You don't need to worry about the pain of gathering the data, setting up the database or the code to talk with the devices. We do the heavy lifting. 
                            
                            You provide the definition of the product to be built. One of the biggest reasons for failure is building the wrong product--a product that you do not want. We build the product you want to gather the data. We figure out the technical how-to. You tell us what you want for your business. We work to define your objectives and the key indicators that will tell you if you’re reaching your goal and confirm your beliefs about your organization.</p>

                            We believe that no successful company should be without technology support to achieve their business requirements.

We like to make our customers smarter by providing dashboards and visual systems that serve to help them understand their own data. It is a great feeling knowing how the new information gathering effort is increasing profits and reducing company waste
